## ✅ Task 1 – Overview of Digital VLSI SoC Design and Planning

---

### 1. Chip Modeling (O1)

The SoC design process begins by creating a **C-based model** of the chip. This model outlines how the system is supposed to function at a high level, without worrying about hardware specifics. It's used as a **reference model** to validate functionality early through test cases and simulations. This ensures that the logic is well-understood before diving into actual hardware design.

---

### 2. RTL Architecture (O2)

After the C model behaves as expected, the design is implemented in **Register Transfer Level (RTL)** using hardware languages like **Verilog or VHDL**. RTL adds the concept of **timing and signal flow**, making it suitable for synthesis.

Key blocks at this stage include:

* **Processor Core**: Often RISC-V or ARM cores
* **Peripheral Interfaces**: UART, SPI, I2C, etc.
* **Analog-like digital models**: Digital representations of analog components (like PLLs)

The synthesis step converts RTL into:

* **Gate-Level Netlist**
* **Soft Macros** – flexible blocks from RTL
* **Hard Macros** – pre-built blocks with fixed layout

### 3. SoC Integration (O3)

Now, all individual components are **combined into one SoC**. This includes processor cores, peripherals, GPIOs, and any analog IPs. Proper integration ensures smooth communication between blocks.

Post-integration, system-level verification is performed to check that the integrated RTL matches the original **C model functionality**.

### 4. Physical Design Flow (RTL → GDSII)

This step translates RTL code into a **layout that can be manufactured**.

</p>  

Important steps in this flow:

* **Floorplanning**: Allocating chip area for different blocks
* **Placement**: Positioning standard cells
* **Routing**: Connecting the cells with metal layers
* **Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS)**: Ensuring balanced clock distribution

Two essential checks:

* **DRC (Design Rule Check)** – Ensures layout follows fabrication rules
* **LVS (Layout vs Schematic)** – Ensures layout matches logical design

The final result is a **GDSII file**, the standard format sent to the fabrication foundry.

| Term           | Description                                    | Example                  |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Soft Macro** | RTL-based block, flexible and reusable         | ALU, FIFO                |
| **Hard Macro** | Pre-layout block, fixed physical layout        | SRAM, PLL                |
| **GDSII**      | Final layout file format for fabrication       | GDSII of entire chip     |
| **DRC**        | Check for manufacturing design rule compliance | Spacing, width checks    |
| **LVS**        | Verifies physical layout matches logic design  | RTL vs Layout comparison |

### 6. Additional Insights

Modern SoCs combine a large number of subsystems including digital logic, analog circuits, and memory. As chip complexity increases, **power, performance, and area (PPA)** become critical factors. Verifying timing, power integrity, and logical correctness are essential to avoid costly design mistakes. There's a growing trend in using **AI-driven design tools** and exploring **advanced nodes** for better performance.

* Use advanced EDA tools like **Synopsys PrimeTime** and **Cadence Innovus**
* Start working on a small SoC project to apply this complete flow in a practical way
