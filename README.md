# RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program – VSD & IIT Gandhinagar

Welcome to my personal repository for the RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program!

This repository contains my weekly submissions, notes, and observations as I participate in the hands-on VLSI training initiative jointly organized by VLSI System Design (VSD) and the Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar (IITGn).

## 🎯 Program Goals

This 20-week training is designed to provide a comprehensive learning experience in digital VLSI and SoC design. It covers the entire chip development flow — from RTL design to layout and tapeout — using industry-standard tools and real PDKs.

The key objectives of the program are:

- To enable end-to-end understanding of SoC development
- To bridge the gap between academic learning and practical chip design
- To train students and engineers on both open-source and commercial EDA tools
- To prepare participants for real-world semiconductor roles

## 🛠 Tools & Technology

Participants gain experience working with:

- RISC-V based SoC design
- Synopsys EDA tools
- SCL 180nm Process Design Kit (PDK)
- Linux-based design environments

## 📆 Weekly Progress

| Week | Topics Covered                                             | Status     |
|------|------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| 0    | Introduction to SoC design, Digital VLSI basics, Tool setup | ✅ Completed |

This repository will be updated every week with logs, scripts, reports, and reflections as I progress through the program.

## 🙏 Gratitude

I sincerely thank the teams at VSD and IIT Gandhinagar for organizing this initiative, and Synopsys for providing access to professional-grade tools. I’m excited to be part of a program that aligns strongly with India’s semiconductor mission and look forward to the learning journey ahead.
